Banking is always an adverse topic. The project aims to provide an interface to both the banking official and the customer without any leak of data thereon. The project is self explanatory and various search filters are provided in the program for smooth functioning of the program.

  The system provides two interfaces on the command line, one for the customer and other for the banking official.
  
  The tasks accessible to the banker are:
  1. Add new account to the central database
  2. Delete Accounts from the central database.
  3. View/List accounts available.
  4.Do various tasks for the customer.
